h1. Cortito Mac OS X Automator Action & Service

This project creates an action which allows users to shorten URLs from "Automator":http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/, using a backend instance of  "cortito":http://github.com/akosma/cortito.

h2. How to use

# Change the URL of your preferred cortito installation (by default it's "http://akos.ma/":http://akos.ma/)
# Build the project in "Release" mode.
# Go to the "build/Release" subfolder and double-click on the ShortenWithCortito.action file. This will install a new workflow action in Automator.
# You can use this action, for example, to create a Mac OS X "service" (such a project is included in the "Workflow" subfolder). Install this service in ~/Library/Services to be able to shorten URLs from most Mac OS X applications.
